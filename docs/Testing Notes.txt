Notes on the invocation name 'Parliament':

On the 26th May I received certification feedback that stated:

'Your skill does not meet  invocation name requirement   #2: One-word invocation names are not allowed, unless the invocation name is unique to your brand/intellectual property. '

That same day I submitted a customer service case [#2215036261] which detailed why I feel this skill falls under the brand/intellectual property exemption.

I work for Parliament (http://parliament.uk) and have developed this skill in my official capacity of Lead Back-end developer.

My work email account is raynerm@parliament.uk if you require additional verification.

We are an official British government organisation, first established in 1707 I would argue we fall under the brand/intellectual property exemption.

Additional proof of my employment at parliament can be found here:

Testing information:

The data the skill gets comes from
http://calendar.parliament.uk.

The idea of the skill is to effectively read the content of the House of Commons and House of Lords events out to the user.

This data is dependent on wha't going on at Parliament. If you are testing and there are no events listed on http://calendar.parliament.uk, the expected response will tell you that there are no events.

If you can update the lambda functions's date to: 2017-02-22 you will get an example of a complete read out.

Short of that, the UK Parliament will next re-open with a full schedule of events in late June after state opening on the 19th.

Ask:
What's on at Parliament?
What's on at the House of Commons?
What's on at the House of Lords?

Answer yes for a full read out when there are events.
